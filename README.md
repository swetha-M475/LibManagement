# Library Management and Book Selling Platform

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a web-based platform that seamlessly integrates library management with a book selling system, providing users and administrators with an efficient and user-friendly environment for managing, browsing, and purchasing books. The system aims to:

1. **Display Books Effectively**
   - Present all available books in the library with details such as title, author, genre, and availability.
   - Organize books under various themes or categories for easier browsing.

2. **Book Management and Storage**
   - Maintain a digital record of all books including their stock, themes, and related information.
   - Enable administrators to add, edit, or remove books from the platform as needed.

3. **User Interaction and Cart Management**
   - Allow users to browse books by category or theme and add selected books to a virtual cart for borrowing or purchase.
   - Provide a clear interface for users to review and manage their cart items before checkout.

4. **Admin Verification and Control**
   - Enable administrators to verify and approve transactions or book requests to ensure proper inventory management.
   - Monitor stock levels and user requests, providing a controlled system for library and book selling operations.

5. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Ensure smooth navigation, search, and book selection processes.
   - Facilitate easy borrowing or purchase workflow while maintaining library records digitally.

## Front-End Infrastructure
The front-end is the part of the system that interacts with the user.

**Technologies / Tools:**
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript:** For designing forms, layouts, and user interface elements.
- **AJAX / XMLHttpRequest:** For asynchronous validation and interactions without reloading the page.
- **Bootstrap (optional):** For responsive design and modern UI components.
- **Browser:** Users interact via standard web browsers like Chrome or Firefox.

**Front-End Components:**
1. **Book Display Page:** Shows available books with details: name, author, theme, availability.
2. **Cart Interface:** Allows users to add/remove books and view selected items before checkout.
3. **User Forms:** Signup/login forms, search functionality, filtering by themes.
4. **Admin Dashboard (UI):** To verify cart requests, add/update book details, manage themes/categories.

## Back-End Infrastructure
The back-end handles data storage, business logic, and validation.

**Technologies / Tools:**
- **PHP:** Handles server-side logic like field validation, processing user requests, and cart management.
- **JSP / Java Servlets:** Manages registration, admin verification, and complex workflows.
- **MySQL:** Stores all data:
  - Books (name, theme, author, stock)
  - Users (name, email, password, role)
  - Cart and transactions
- **XAMPP:** Apache server for PHP processing and MySQL database management.
- **Tomcat Server (if JSP used):** Serves JSP pages and handles Java-based server logic.

**Back-End Components:**
1. **Database:** Tables for users, books, categories/themes, cart items, and transactions.
2. **Server-side Scripts:**
   - PHP: validate input fields, add items to cart, retrieve book lists.
   - JSP/Servlets: handle registration, cart verification by admin, checkout processing.
3. **APIs / AJAX Endpoints:**
   - `validate.php` for field validation
   - JSP endpoints for registration and admin actions

## How to Run the Project

1. Place the PHP files in `C:\xampp\htdocs\LibraryManagement\`.
2. Place JSP files in Tomcat: `C:\xampp\tomcat\webapps\LibraryManagement\`.
3. Start **Apache** (for PHP) and **Tomcat** (for JSP) in XAMPP.
4. Access the application in browser:
   - PHP (field validation, index pages): `http://localhost/LibraryManagement/`
   - JSP (registration, admin actions): `http://localhost:8080/LibraryManagement/`
5. Ensure MySQL database is running and tables are created as per project schema.
